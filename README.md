Here You can find various work done by me <br>

Language used :- Python 
ide - jupyter notebook
Library - numpy for mathematical calculation 
          pandas for creating Dataframe manipulationg Dataframe, Preprocessing Data Field
          Matplotlib and Seabron for plotting the plot
          sklearn for various algorithms
          
algorithms used :
                 Random Forest
                 XGbooost
                 K-means
                 Hierarichal 
                 Regularization (Lasso and Ridge)
                 
Steps follwed in various Project
 
 
Loading Data with the  help of Pandas
preproecessing data 
    i checking null value and imputing
    ii. checking duplicates
    iii. Handling Categorical columns which have so many cateogory in it 
    iv. Understanding Data by by EDA
 splitting data in 70/30
 Scaling Data whereever required
 model building 
 Model evaluation by various parameter 
 For regression :-RMSE
 For CLassification :- Accuracy score or AUC-ROC SCOre(for imbalance data)
 
 Finalizing and conclusion of model
